# Python Dependency Management 🛠️

All dependencies installed via pip must be automatically added to the requirements.txt file.

## Rules

1. **After each package installation via pip**: Update requirements.txt
2. **Before making changes**:
   - Check if new imports require package installation
   - If so, install them and update requirements.txt

## Examples

### ✅ Good Workflow

```bash
# Install package
pip install requests

# Update requirements
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

### ❌ Bad Practice

```bash
# Install package but forget to update requirements
pip install requests
# (missing requirements.txt update)
```

## Motivation

- 🔒 **Reproducibility**: Ensures consistent environments
- 📦 **Dependency Tracking**: All required packages are documented
- 🤝 **Team Collaboration**: Easy setup for other developers
