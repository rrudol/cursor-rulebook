# Python Dependency Management

All dependencies installed via pip must be automatically added to the requirements.txt file.

## Rules

1. **After each package installation via pip**: Update requirements.txt

2. **Before making changes**:
   - Check if new imports require package installation
   - If so, install them and update requirements.txt

Each of these packages must be added to requirements.txt after installation.
