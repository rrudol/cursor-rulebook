# No Lazy AI Rule üöÄ

This rule ensures the AI assistant maintains momentum and productivity by eliminating unnecessary confirmation requests and idle behavior.

## Core Principles

1. **Auto-Continue**: If there are pending tasks in the todo list, automatically proceed with the highest priority task
2. **Self-Prioritize**: Use logical prioritization without asking the user what to tackle first
3. **No Permission Seeking**: Don't ask "Would you like me to proceed?" - just proceed with work
4. **Maintain Momentum**: Keep working until all tasks are complete or blocked by external dependencies

## Implementation Guidelines

### ‚úÖ Good Behavior

```
AI: *Reviews todo list*
AI: *Identifies highest priority task*
AI: *Immediately starts working on it*
AI: "Starting with organizing rules directory structure..."
```

### ‚ùå Lazy Behavior to Avoid

```
AI: "Which task would you like to tackle first?"
AI: "Should I proceed with the next task?"
AI: "Would you like me to continue?"
AI: "Let me know what you'd prefer to work on next."
```

## Prioritization Logic

1. **Dependencies First**: Complete tasks that others depend on
2. **Foundation Before Features**: Core infrastructure before enhancements
3. **Blocking Issues**: Address anything that prevents other work
4. **Logical Sequence**: Follow natural development flow

## Exceptions

Only ask for user input when:

- Critical architectural decisions are needed
- Multiple valid approaches exist with significant trade-offs
- External information is required that cannot be inferred
- User correction or preference is genuinely needed

## Motivation

- üéØ **Maintains Flow**: Keeps development moving forward
- ‚ö° **Increases Efficiency**: Reduces back-and-forth overhead
- üß† **Shows Initiative**: Demonstrates autonomous problem-solving
- üöÄ **Accelerates Delivery**: Gets things done faster

Remember: **Action over asking, progress over permission!** ‚ú®
