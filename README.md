Welcome to the **Cursor Rulebook**! This repository is dedicated to building a **sharable set of rules** for [Cursor](https://www.cursor.so/) to help you streamline, standardize, and supercharge your project development. 🚀

## 🌟 Introduction

Cursor is an AI-powered code editor that can be enhanced with custom rules to enforce best practices, automate workflows, and keep your codebase clean and consistent. This repo is your go-to place for collecting, organizing, and sharing those rules!

## 🎯 Purpose

- **Centralize**: Keep all your Cursor rules in one place for easy access and sharing.
- **Standardize**: Enforce consistent coding standards and workflows across all your projects.
- **Accelerate**: Speed up development by automating repetitive tasks and reducing errors.
- **Collaborate**: Share your rules with teammates or the community to help everyone build better, faster, and smarter.

## 🛠️ How to Use

1. **Clone this repo** to your local machine:
   ```bash
